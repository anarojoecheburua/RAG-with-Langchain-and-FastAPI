# 🚀 RAG System with LangChain and FastAPI 🌐

Welcome to this repository! This project demonstrates how to build a powerful RAG system using **LangChain** and **FastAPI** for generating contextually relevant and accurate responses by integrating external data into the generative process.

## 📋 Project Overview

The RAG system combines retrieval and generation to provide smarter AI-driven responses. Using **LangChain** for document handling and embeddings, and **FastAPI** for deploying a fast, scalable API, this project includes:

- 🗂️ **Document Loading**: Load data from various sources (text, PDFs, etc.).
- ✂️ **Text Splitting**: Break large documents into manageable chunks.
- 🧠 **Embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings for efficient search and retrieval.
- 🔍 **Vector Stores**: Store embeddings in a vector store for fast similarity searches.
- 🔧 **Retrieval**: Retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- 💬 **Generative Response**: Use retrieved data with language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
- 🌐 **FastAPI**: Deploy the RAG system as a scalable API for easy interaction.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 🐳 Docker (optional, for deployment)
- 🛠️ PostgreSQL or FAISS (for vector storage)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anarojoecheburua/RAG-with-Lanchain-and-FastAPI.git
   cd rag-system
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   Now, your FastAPI app will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` 🎉!

## 🛠️ Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines the best of both worlds—retrieving relevant data and generating insightful responses.
- **Scalable API**: FastAPI makes it easy to deploy and scale the RAG system.
- **Document Handling**: Supports multiple document types for loading and processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Efficient search with FAISS or other vector stores.

## 🛡️ Security

- 🔐 **OAuth2 and API Key** authentication support for secure API access.
- 🔒 **TLS/SSL** for encrypting data in transit.
- 🛡️ **Data encryption** for sensitive document storage.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Deployment
If you want to deploy your RAG system using Docker, simply build the Docker image and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t rag-system .
docker run -p 8000:8000 rag-system
```

### Cloud Deployment
Deploy your RAG system to the cloud using platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud** with minimal setup.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- 🔄 **Real-time Data Integration**: Add real-time data sources for dynamic responses.
- 🤖 **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Implement deep learning-based retrievers for better query understanding.
- 📊 **Monitoring Tools**: Add monitoring with tools like Prometheus or Grafana for performance insights.
